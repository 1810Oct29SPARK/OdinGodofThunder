              <p>The mind of someome who is diagnosed with ADHD is a peculiar one. They regulate thing emotions and attention differently than most. its not that they don't have enough attention. its that their brain hey just canâ€™t harness it in the right direction at the right time with any consistency. And so individuals with ADHD hyperfocus and lose track of time, or misplace their keys, or blurt out an unrelated thought when their focus breaks free from its chains. Honestly attention deficit is a misleading name. I prefer the term attention deregulation. ADHD is more than just forgetting things and daydreaming more often than not. ADHD reeks havac on someones emotions and causes serious relational issues. i hope that by going through this site, that people will gain a better understanding of this disorder and the people who have it. if you want to get more info on it, you can check out https://www.additudemag.com/ and CHADD(Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder).
			CHADD is a non profit organization dedicated to heling improve the lives of those with adhd with education, advocacy and support. check them out to get more info.</p>
