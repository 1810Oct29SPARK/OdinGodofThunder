                  <li class="relationships" id="cues"><h3>Difficulty reading social cues and non-verbal communication</h3><p>In general adults with ADHD may not be the best about reading other people's facial expressions or body language, causing them to miss important information most of us would pick up quickly and instinctively. Partially this may because their ADHD makes it harder for them to interpret this channel of communication. They may also not be paying attention to non-verbal cues because their minds are distracted and focused on other things.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="blurt"><h3>Blurting out inappropriate comments</h3><p>One feature of ADHD is impulsivity. In conversations an adult with ADHD may accidentally offend someone by saying something inappropriate the instant it pops into their head.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="rude"><h3>Interrupting</h3><p>This is another aspect of being impulsive. Someone may frequently interrupt the people they're talking to. They may also butt into conversations. If they think of something they want to say they may start speaking before taking the time to realize that now wouldn't be the best time to do it.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="talk"><h3>Talking too much</h3><p>Adults with ADHD sometimes talk on and on and on. This can be because they feel an internal pressure to keep speaking. They may also be enthusiastically chatting about a topic, and miss the non-verbal signs that the other people aren't that interested and would like them to move on to something else.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="listen"><h3>Not being a good listener</h3><p>The points above can contribute to an adult with ADHD not listening well. Rather than letting the other person speak, they're jumping in with their own points. Their distractibility and trouble focusing can also come into play. They may be trying their best to concentrate on what the other person is saying, but their minds have three other things going on at the same time. This can get even worse during chaotic group conversations.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="spacey"><h3>Coming across as distracted and spacey</h3><p>This can be another effect of their difficulty with focusing on one subject. While trying to pay attention to another person, they may not be able to keep their mind from drifting off or fixating on something else.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="subject"><h3>Changing conversation topics a little too randomly</h3><p>Someone with ADHD may start talking about something new seemingly out of nowhere. While everyone else was speaking their thoughts went off in a different direction, arriving at their current topic. However, they didn't let everyone else in on how they got there.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships"  id="lang"><h3>Having trouble with their own body language and personal space</h3><p>People with ADHD sometimes aren't aware of their own body language, and may adopt an awkward or closed-off stance without realizing it. They can also be overly fidgety. They may not have a sense of how much personal space other people need, and invade it without meaning to.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="friends"><h3>Their difficulty with getting things done affecting their friendships</h3><p>As I said earlier, adults with ADHD have trouble managing their time, and starting and finishing tasks. This most obviously hinders their careers, but it can also get in the way of their relationships</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="anger"><h3>Being irritable and quick-tempered</h3><p>As I was saying in the introduction to this article, not everyone with ADHD presents in the same way. For some people the hyperactive/impulsive side of the condition shows up as them being impatient, temperamental, and easily irritated. I don't really need to explain how this can sabotage their relationships.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="risk"><h3>Risky behavior</h3><p>In their need for stimulation some adults with ADHD take a lot of risks. Channeled properly this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it can shape their friendships. They may party too hard, or do dumb physical stunts. Not everyone may have the stomach for that kind of lifestyle or behavior.</p></li>
                  <li class="relationships" id="flex"><h3>Lack of flexibility</h3><p>This one can be a side effect of the methods someone can employ to keep their symptoms in check. Some adults with ADHD find that they function best when they keep themselves to a tight, organized schedule. This can cause problems when they feel they can't stray from that structure. For example, a woman may have an evening routine she follows, and tries to force her friends to go along with it as well when they're all hanging out.</p></li>

          <h2>dating</h2>
            <p> Most of these issues bleed into thier love life.We also sweep people off their feet with our intense emotions. We need the immediate gratification of succeeding at the relationship, so we justify moving forward way too fast. We convince ourselves and our partners that this is absolutely the real thing, and there is no reason to wait and see how it goes. When someone with adhd falls in love, they will fall hard. In the early stages of a relationship, the person with ADHD might hyperfocus on their partner, so that it seems like they're the ~center of their world. But when their easily bored minds kick in and life takes over, that hyperfocus may turn into forgetfullness and lack of attention. Their inability to pay attention may across as apathethic and aloof which makes the partner seem left out and unloved. Its not enough that they may have to deal with our disorganization and forgetful nature. With the way their emotions are, people with adhd have problem with regulating their emotion and inhibition which could lead easily becoming frustrated or upset. When they are upset, they can really lose thier cool and it could lead to violence or hurtful comments. by the time we catch ourselves, it may be too late. </p>
