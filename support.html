            <ul><li>Keep a planner. As soon as you make an appointment, record it in your planner and prioritize activities in order of importance. Take things one at a time in order to stay on schedule and stay on task.</li></ul>
			 <ul><li>get enough sleep. avoid coffee or any stimulants in the evening.</li></ul>
			  <ul><li>Be attentive to others by complementing them, listening to them, asking questions, etc.</li></ul>
			   <ul><li>Emulate the behaviors of others; follow the examples of people with good social skills. Practice observing wherever you go; observe rather than act for a while. Pay close attention to non-verbal communication to learn how to interpret it.</li></ul>
			    <ul><li>Think in terms of what you can bring to the friendship. Find and join positive groups where youâ€™re accepted and fit in; look for groups that match your interests, skills, and energy levels such as hiking, biking, or other active groups as well as volunteer organizations like Habitat for Humanity. Remove yourself from negative people and groups that disrespect you and devalue you. </li></ul>
				 <ul><li>set alarms for activities. set timers for activites so that you can stay on task and schedule. </li></ul>
				  <ul><li>Working out is perhaps the most positive and efficient way to reduce hyperactivity and inattention from ADHD. Exercise can relieve stress, boost your mood, and calm your mind, helping work off the excess energy and aggression that can get in the way of relationships and feeling stable.</li></ul>
				   <ul><li>give yourself more tiime than you think to get ready and plan to be early. this may require setting up multiple reminders. </li></ul>
				    <ul><li>Improve your diet- avoid junk food is key to controlling symptoms. eat small meals and have a healthy protein rich meal. </li></ul>
					<ul><li>shop with cash to avoid impulse shopping and establish a budget. </li></ul>
					<ul><li>clean up messes to get rid of clutter immediatley.</li></ul>
					<ul><li>sleep deprivation has been known to  reduce your ability to cope with stress and maintain focus during the day. Simple changes to daytime habits go a long way toward ensuring solid nightly sleep.  By avoiding coffee or any stimulants in the evening and creating a regular and predictable and quiet bedtime routine, you will begin to get a solid eight hours of sleep.</li></ul>
					<ul><li>Keep a sense of humor and learn how to laugh at yourself.</li></ul>
					<ul><li>Don't be afraid to seek counsel and get help from counselors or doctors. they go a long way.</li></ul>

				<p>Its not a death sentence.Its not debilitating. But it doesn't change the fact that ADHD can be a pain in the you know where. When i was younger, I didn't understand just how much it affected my life. but as i started to get older and adult life started kicking in, i really started seeing the impact that it has had upon my life. I can go on about how  i constantly got angry lectures from my teachers for forgetting assignments and being scared to show my report card to my mom. i could tell you about all the detentions and the suspensions for being unable to control my temper. All the times i have alienated myself and ruined potential friendships and relationships by missing social cues, blurting out innapropiate comments or just saying stupid nonsense. Its tough to swallow, but none of that stuff pales in comparison to the strain i put on my own family. My behavior caused alot of frustration and exhasparation in my family. especially with my mother. growing up, i can hear my mother praying in her room, crying out to God that he would heal me so i could be a more productive human being. It breaks my heart to be such a burden on my family. I took a lot of Ls to say the least. After a while if you are not careful, those L's will start to get to you and you start thinking that "the world would be better off without you. You begin to lose hope and stop believing in yourself. You feel like everything you do ends up to total failure and believe that you won't accomplish much. While adhd may be a hinderance, it should not stop you completley from living the life you desire and being successful. You have the power to be successful. while we may be deficient in our attention span and other areas, we have quirks that we can use to our advantage. When we find what we something that we love and catches our attention, we become hyperfocused on it and it becomes our driving force. With our constant daydreaming, we have this innate ability to be creative. When you use those quirks and gifts to your advantage, nothing will stop you and the sky is your limit. ADHD does not define you. YOU define what you do with adhd.</p>
