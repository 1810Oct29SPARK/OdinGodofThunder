<p>It all started int eh 1800s when a local carnival strong man would begin challenging locals to matches that would aways end up in his favor because the matches would be fixed in his favor.
    Realizing that they could make more money off the crowd than entry fees, they began taking wagers on the fight and even having challengers in on the fix, using fake names and hyping the fight.

  <p class="promo">After years of many promotions with many championships with little significance, Promotors created the NWA(the national wrestling association that featured one single championship.</p>
      <aside> <p>Although the NWA split into different Regions after World war II, they still kept thier gentlemens agreement. In that agreement, they would not steal each others talent or move shows into each others territory</p>

    <p>However that agreemeent would be broken by Vince Mcmahon Sr. Known then as WWWF(World Wide Wrestling Federation, his son Vince Mcmahon jr would steal talent from other territories, promote shows on their turfs and secure great cable deals. Eventuallly the other territories died out. </p>

 <p>WCW would go head to head with now World Wrestling Federation and would beat them for a while in ratings. However WWF would eventually rebound and win the famous Monday Night WAr. Vince mcmahon would later buy WCW in 2001. </p>

<aside> <p>There has always been a huge debate on what caused the demise of WCW. When most people look at the wcw product in the late 90s up to its closing,</p>
        <p>many people blame the fall of WCW on poor management that lacked strong leadersship, poor booking decisions that failed to build new superstars,
         too much creative power given to ego maniac superstars who held down everyone and most of all, WWE having much better characters and being just too red hot</p>
